In this lab the terminal is divided into two terminals to make navigation easier.

IMPORTANT:
We'll use the top half for podman related tasks. We'll use the bottom half for RHEL host related tasks.

In the top terminal, run the following command.

[source,bash,run]
----
sudo -i

In the top terminal, enter the following command to view the existing images on the RHEL
host.

[source,bash,run]
----
podman images

There is one container available in the local (localhost) repository,
*rhel9-httpd*. If there were multiple updated iterations of the
conatiner available, you would use the *IMAGE ID* to work with those
that are not tagged as *latest*. Also, from this list you are able to
see the size, on disk, of the container image.
