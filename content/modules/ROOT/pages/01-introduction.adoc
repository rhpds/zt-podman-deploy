In this lab we have two terminals to make navigation easier. The
`+Podman+` terminal will be used for podman related tasks. The
`+RHEL Host+` tab will be used for host related tasks.

There is one container available in the local (localhost) repository,
*rhel9-httpd*. If there were multiple updated iterations of the
conatiner available, you would use the *IMAGE ID* to work with those
that are not tagged as *latest*. Also, from this list you are able to
see the size, on disk, of the container image.
