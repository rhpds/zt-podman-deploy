When the process on an interactive container is closed, the container
stops running. You can verify this by looking at the list of container
processes.

A container in this state can be resumed, however, this one will no
longer be used. You will remove it from the system. using *podman rm *.
In the command below, we use a bit of bash scripting to determine the
CONTAINER ID as it is unique to each container image.

[source,bash,run]
----
podman rm $(podman ps -a | grep Exited | cut -d" " -f1)
----

The output of this removal is the full CONTAINER ID which was removed
from the system.
