Unlike interactive containers, detached containers are stopped using
*podman stop *.

[source,bash,run]
----
podman stop $(podman ps -a | grep Up | cut -d" " -f1)
----

In the command above, we use a bit of bash scripting to determine the
*CONTAINER ID* as it is going to be a value unique to each container
image.

You can verify that the container is now exited:

[source,bash,run]
----
podman ps -a
----
